Prompt :
When building an app using an API we usually convert the API response to custom objects in our app. eg. In Swift we would define structs or classes. Could you give me the benefits of using custom entities (such as structs or classes) for representing data in your app.

AI Response :
Certainly! Here are some benefits of using custom entities (such as structs or classes) for representing data in your app:

1. Strong Typing: Custom entities provide a strong type system that allows for more precise and reliable coding. By defining specific properties and their types in your custom entities, you can catch compile-time errors and ensure that the data adheres to the expected structure.

2. Data Abstraction: Custom entities provide a layer of abstraction between the raw API response and the rest of your app. They encapsulate the data and provide a more structured and meaningful representation that is tailored to your app's needs. This abstraction improves code organization and makes your app more maintainable.

3. Modularity and Reusability: By separating the data representation into custom entities, you can easily reuse and share these entities across different parts of your app or even in different projects. This promotes modular design and code reusability, reducing the duplication of code and improving development efficiency.

4. Encapsulation of Logic: Custom entities allow you to encapsulate business logic or behavior related to the data. You can define methods or computed properties within your entities to perform calculations, validations, or transformations on the data. This keeps the logic closely tied to the data it operates on and helps maintain a clean separation of concerns.

5. Serialization and Deserialization: Custom entities can easily conform to serialization and deserialization protocols, such as Codable in Swift. This enables seamless conversion between your custom entities and various data formats, such as JSON or binary, making it simpler to parse API responses and persist or transmit the data.

6. Better Data Integrity and Validation: With custom entities, you can implement data validation and integrity checks directly within the entity itself. By defining validation rules or constraints as part of the entity's implementation, you can ensure that the data conforms to specific requirements before it is used within your app.

7. Improved Readability and Understanding: Custom entities provide semantic meaning to the data. By giving properties and methods meaningful names that represent the data they encapsulate, custom entities make the code more readable, self-explanatory, and easier to understand for other developers working on the project.

8. Encapsulation of Data Sources: Custom entities can encapsulate not only the API response but also data from other sources, such as local storage or user input. This allows for consistent handling and manipulation of data throughout your app, irrespective of its source.

By utilizing custom entities, you can establish a clear and structured representation of data in your app, enhancing the readability, maintainability, and extensibility of your codebase. Custom entities make it easier to handle and manipulate data, enforce data integrity, encapsulate business logic, and provide a modular and reusable approach to data representation.

Additionally, using custom entities aligns well with modern programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming (OOP) or functional programming (FP). They promote encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity, enabling you to build well-organized, scalable, and maintainable codebases.

Overall, leveraging custom entities for representing data in your app brings numerous benefits including improved type safety, modular design, code reusability, better data integrity, and enhanced code readability. It allows for a focused representation of the data specific to your app's domain, leading to more robust and efficient app development.
